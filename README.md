FizzBuzz Challenge
Coding Challenge â€“ Implement the FizzBuzz Rules

Here are the FizzBuzz rules that you need to implement in your code project:

Output values from 1 to 100, one number per line, inside an iteration block of code.
When the current value is divisible by 3, print the term "Fizz" next to the number.
When the current value is divisible by 5, print the term "Buzz" next to the number.
When the current value is divisible by both 3 and 5, print the term "FizzBuzz" next to the number.
